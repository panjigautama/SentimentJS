         <small>The Actions analysis delivers a set of signals that describe the actions that have been, are being, or may be undertaken in the text. Actions are presented not just as simple verbs, but in combination with their objects ("buy a car"). Tenses are analyzed and presented, along with any specific temporal references ("this week" or "at Easter") and other information. Describes the action (for example, "give a dollar") and its weight in the text. This is the percentage of the total of all action weights in the document.</small>

   <blockquote>
      <small>
         <br><strong>Type</strong> - broad category to the action
         <br><br><strong>Decisiveness</strong> - measure of how likely the action is to take place ("I'm definitely buying that car!" versus "I'm considering getting a new car.")
         <br><br><strong>Temporality</strong> - indications regarding the time-frame for the action. This might be simply past, present, or future, or can include specific times or dates ("this Christmas").
         <br><br><strong>Offering Guidance</strong> - estimates the degree to which the text offers guidance or advice in relation to the specific action
         <br><br><strong>Requesting Guidance</strong> - estimates the degree to which the text is requesting guidance or advice in relation to the specific action

      <small>
         <br><strong>Flamboyance</strong> - How can you tell if you are reading Henry James or Ernest Hemingway? Is the breathless recounting of a fabulous vacation trip the same as the dour enumeration of API features found in technical documentation? The Flamboyance score of a document is the key to answering these two questions, as well as more open ended questions about text genre or target audience.
         <br><br><strong>Slang</strong> - This variable can be useful in assessing the characteristics of the author or intended audience. Vocabulary contributes heavily to the measurement of slang usage, although other linguistic constructs are also measured.
         <br><br><strong>Contrast</strong> - This variable detects the degree to which divergent opinions are expressed in a text. As such, it is useful as an indicator of possible conflict, of dialogue versus monologue, etc.
         <br><br><strong>Offering & Requesting Guidance</strong> - This variables help identify an author's relationship to topics they discuss. For example, a topic that returns a strong value for requesting guidance may indicate an opportunity for providing advice. A text where multiple topics get high values for offering guidance may be instructional or inspirational in nature. Guidance provides rich signals whose creative use, especially in combination with other signals such as action and temporality, can offer deep insight into needs and motivations.
         <br><br><strong>Decisiveness</strong> - indicates for each action, how likely the action is to be taken
